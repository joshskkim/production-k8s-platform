# AtlasK8s Architecture Guide

## High-Level Architecture

[Architecture Diagram - To be added]

## Design Decisions

### Why Kubernetes?
- Container orchestration at scale
- Declarative infrastructure management
- Rich ecosystem and cloud-native patterns
- Industry standard for modern applications

### Why Terraform?
- Infrastructure as Code with state management
- Multi-cloud provider support
- Modular and reusable infrastructure components
- Version control and collaboration capabilities

### Technology Choices

**Go API Gateway**: Chosen for high performance, low memory footprint, and excellent HTTP handling capabilities. Demonstrates systems programming skills.

**Java Spring Boot**: Enterprise-standard framework showing knowledge of production Java patterns, dependency injection, and comprehensive observability.

**Python FastAPI**: Modern async framework for high-performance APIs, demonstrates Python expertise and async programming patterns.

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal pod autoscaling based on CPU/memory metrics
- Cluster autoscaling for dynamic node provisioning  
- Load balancing with AWS Application Load Balancer
- Caching strategy with Redis for session and data caching
- Database connection pooling and read replicas

## Security Architecture

- Network segmentation with VPC and security groups
- Kubernetes RBAC for fine-grained access control
- Pod security contexts preventing privilege escalation
- Secrets management for sensitive configuration
- TLS termination at load balancer level
